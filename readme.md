## ‚ùì What is this?

This is a desktop app for all platforms (mac, windows and linux) which can automate your any social media platform. As you can see in the preview you can create scenarios like let's say when something happens on the one social media it will be re-posted to another one(or same one but on different account). 

This app also let's you schedule posts for any social media. In case, You don't want to be online at certain time or may be your audience is in different timezone than you.

Just imagine you are a big corporate like marvel and want to post certain news on all social media accounts at the same time. 

Or You are a Social media infulancer and you want to like/retweet all the post which shows up in certain #Ô∏è‚É£hashtag on twitter or instagram.

This app does that.

### ü§î Problem

I like being on social media. But if you want to grow your audience they really make it hard to do so. First, you have to manage so many of them. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Youtube and list goes on ... Second, You have to be active on them. Now one person can be active on 1 or two of them but being active on all of them daily is heavy task. But they won't take you seriously if you are not active and not engaging with posts(or putting one). Which results in you not having enough audience or exposure in that platform.

They are doing this because they want to promote their paid products like in facebook they ask person who posted for money to make this post reachable to all of his/her followers. While linkedIn offers paid membership based on how active you are on their platform. 

Ultimately, They track who is active and who is not and order other's feed based on that. If you are active then you will get audience automatically which is organic to your content which will make you use(or be active on) that platform more than other platforms. 

So, This is their way to attract you by giving you incentives every once in a while. It's common psychology practice. 

But I don't have 1 hour a day for each one (and how could I? there are dozens of them) and I want to be active for that shiny incentive which I am lured into. 

### üí° Solution

Solution to this problem is a bot. It will act as logged in user and do the activities same as that user do. So that platform thinks that user is active and organically help user to gain more followers or an audience reach.

## ü§® How it will work?

We will use libraries like Google Puppeteer, ElectronJS and official API of to automate. It will mimic the same steps you would do on the web but it will do it automatically without human interaction. You can always see what it's doing and intervene/stop it at any point of time.

## ‚ö° Features

 - üíØ Totally Free for personal use
 - üîí Complete Privacy (we don't even have servers to store your data)  
 - üöÄ Fast and effective !!!
 - ü§Ø Numerous use case and possibilities

#### Yeah, I can help. I am highly experienced developer
We need someone like you to create a coding architecture. So, that code can be scalable to any use case. also, as this is a open source there will be lot of PRs with a junky code which may be refactored to a simple statements. we need you to use your expertise in that area. 

#### Yes, I am learning programming and I think I can help
Well, you are at right location. have a look at issues and take one which you think you can perform. also just looking and understanding the code will also help you learn a few tricks. you can also add comments to existing code. Even a small comments can speed up the developing process for others. 

#### okay, But I am not a develper
That's fine. not everyone meant to be. You can think of a tasks which is troubling you and which you think can be automated. Raise an issue here. Maybe some developer might have the same problem and decide to work on it. Which will benefit us all.
